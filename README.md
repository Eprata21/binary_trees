A binary tree is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children, which are referred to as the left child and the right child. The left child is always less than the parent node and the right child is always greater than the parent node. A binary tree can be classified into three types: full binary tree, perfect binary tree and complete binary tree. A full binary tree is a tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children. A perfect binary tree is a tree in which all interior nodes have two children and all leaves have the same depth or same level. A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible
